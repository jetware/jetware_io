This is a runtime environment for tutorials and examples of the Udacity's
Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program (nd009t).

###### Runtime environment

The runtime environment includes everything needed for the examples and
tutorials from the course. All programs are built, installed, configured,
tested, and are ready to use.

There are different software bundles (appliances), optimized for different
