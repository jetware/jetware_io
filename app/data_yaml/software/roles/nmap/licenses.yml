    *                                                                         *\n
    * o Includes Covered Software in a proprietary executable installer.  The *\n

    * This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify our interpretation  *\n
    * of derived works with some common examples.  Other people may interpret *\n
    * the plain GPL differently, so we consider this a special exception to   *\n
    * the GPL that we apply to Covered Software.  Works which meet any of     *\n
    * these conditions must conform to all of the terms of this license,      *\n
    * particularly including the GPL Section 3 requirements of providing      *\n
    * source code and allowing free redistribution of the work as a whole.    *\n
    *                                                                         *\n
    * As another special exception to the GPL terms, the Nmap Project grants  *\n
    * permission to link the code of this program with any version of the     *\n
    * OpenSSL library which is distributed under a license identical to that  *\n
    * listed in the included docs/licenses/OpenSSL.txt file, and distribute   *\n
    * linked combinations including the two.                                  *\n
    *                                                                         * \n
    * The Nmap Project has permission to redistribute Npcap, a packet         *\n
    * capturing driver and library for the Microsoft Windows platform.        *\n
    * Npcap is a separate work with it's own license rather than this Nmap    *\n
    * license.  Since the Npcap license does not permit redistribution        *\n
    * without special permission, our Nmap Windows binary packages which      *\n
    * contain Npcap may not be redistributed without special permission.      *\n
    *                                                                         *\n
    * Any redistribution of Covered Software, including any derived works,    *\n
    * must obey and carry forward all of the terms of this license, including *\n
    * obeying all GPL rules and restrictions.  For example, source code of    *\n
    * the whole work must be provided and free redistribution must be         *\n
    * allowed.  All GPL references to \"this License\", are to be treated as    *\n
    * including the terms and conditions of this license text as well.        *\n
    *                                                                         *\n
    * Because this license imposes special exceptions to the GPL, Covered     *\n
    * Work may not be combined (even as part of a larger work) with plain GPL *\n
    * software.  The terms, conditions, and exceptions of this license must   *\n
    * be included as well.  This license is incompatible with some other open *\n
    * source licenses as well.  In some cases we can relicense portions of    *\n
    * Nmap or grant special permissions to use it in other open source        *\n
    * software.  Please contact fyodor@nmap.org with any such requests.       *\n
    * Similarly, we don't incorporate incompatible open source software into  *\n
    * Covered Software without special permission from the copyright holders. *\n
    *                                                                         *\n
    * If you have any questions about the licensing restrictions on using     *\n
    * Nmap in other works, are happy to help.  As mentioned above, we also    *\n
    * offer alternative license to integrate Nmap into proprietary            *\n
    * applications and appliances.  These contracts have been sold to dozens  *\n
    * of software vendors, and generally include a perpetual license as well  *\n
    * as providing for priority support and updates.  They also fund the      *\n
    * continued development of Nmap.  Please email sales@nmap.com for further *\n
    * information.                                                            *\n
    *                                                                         *\n
    * If you have received a written license agreement or contract for        *\n
    * Covered Software stating terms other than these, you may choose to use  *\n
    * and redistribute Covered Software under those terms instead of these.   *\n
    *                                                                         *\n
    * Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a     *\n
    * right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it. *\n
    * This also allows you to audit the software for security holes.          *\n
    *                                                                         *\n
    * Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs,    *\n
    * and add new features.  You are highly encouraged to send your changes   *\n
    * to the dev@nmap.org mailing list for possible incorporation into the    *\n
    * main distribution.  By sending these changes to Fyodor or one of the    *\n
    * Insecure.Org development mailing lists, or checking them into the Nmap  *\n
    * source code repository, it is understood (unless you specify            *\n
    * otherwise) that you are offering the Nmap Project the unlimited,        *\n
    * non-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicense the code.  Nmap     *\n
    * will always be available Open Source, but this is important because     *\n
    * the inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems for     *\n
    * other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM).  We also           *\n
    * occasionally relicense the code to third parties as discussed above.    *\n
    * If you wish to specify special license conditions of your               *\n
    * contributions, just say so when you send them.                          *\n

    GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free
    Software Foundation, Inc.\n59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307,
    USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license
    document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most
    software are designed to take away your freedom to\nshare and change it. By contrast,
    the GNU General Public License is intended\nto guarantee your freedom to share
    and change free software--to make sure\nthe software is free for all its users.
    This General Public License applies\nto most of the Free Software Foundation's
    software and to any other program\nwhose authors commit to using it. (Some other
    Free Software Foundation\nsoftware is covered by the GNU Library General Public
    License instead.) You\ncan apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of
    free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our\nGeneral Public Licenses
    are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\nto distribute copies of free
    software (and charge for this service if you\nwish), that you receive source code
    or can get it if you want it, that you\ncan change the software or use pieces
    of it in new free programs; and that\nyou know you can do these things.\n\nTo
    protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to\ndeny
    you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\nrestrictions translate
    to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\ncopies of the software,
    or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
    whether gratis or\nfor a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    you have. You\nmust make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
    And you\nmust show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your
    rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\noffer you this license
    which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\nAlso,
    for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone
    understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If\nthe software
    is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its\nrecipients to know that
    what they have is not the original, so that any\nproblems introduced by others
    will not reflect on the original authors'\nreputations.\n\nFinally, any free program
    is threatened constantly by software patents. We\nwish to avoid the danger that
    redistributors of a free program will\nindividually obtain patent licenses, in
    effect making the program\nproprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear
    that any patent must be\nlicensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe
    precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n\nTERMS
    AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies
    to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright
    holder saying it may be distributed under the terms\nof this General Public License.
    The \"Program\", below, refers to any such\nprogram or work, and a \"work based
    on the Program\" means either the Program\nor any derivative work under copyright
    law: that is to say, a work\ncontaining the Program or a portion of it, either
    verbatim or with\nmodifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,\ntranslation
    is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each\nlicensee is
    addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification
    are not covered\nby this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
    the Program\nis not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only
    if its\ncontents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
    been\nmade by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the\nProgram
    does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
    code\nas you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately
    publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty;
    keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nLicense and to the absence of
    any warranty; and give any other recipients of\nthe Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring
    a copy, and you\nmay at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for
    a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it,\nthus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\nmodifications
    or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\nalso meet all of
    these conditions:\n\n   * a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
    notices stating\n     that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n
    \  * b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n     whole
    or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n     thereof,
    to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n     under the terms
    of this License.\n\n   * c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when\n     run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use\n
    \    in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including\n
    \    an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty\n
    \    (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may\n     redistribute
    the program under these conditions, and telling the user\n     how to view a copy
    of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself\n     is interactive but does
    not normally print such an announcement, your\n     work based on the Program
    is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the
    modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived
    from the Program, and can be\nreasonably considered independent and separate works
    in themselves, then\nthis License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections
    when you\ndistribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
    sections\nas part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution
    of\nthe whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other\nlicensees
    extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part\nregardless of who
    wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\nthe
    right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works\nbased on
    the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
    Program with\nthe Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage\nor distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope
    of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based
    on it, under\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1\nand 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n   *
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n     code,
    which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2\n     above on a
    medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n   * b) Accompany it
    with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\n     to give any third
    party, for a charge no more than your cost of\n     physically performing source
    distribution, a complete machine-readable\n     copy of the corresponding source
    code, to be distributed under the\n     terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for\n     software interchange; or,\n\n   * c) Accompany it with
    the information you received as to the offer to\n     distribute corresponding
    source code. (This alternative is allowed only\n     for noncommercial distribution
    and only if you received the program in\n     object code or executable form with
    such an offer, in accord with\n     Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for
    a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For
    an executable work, complete source code means all\nthe source code for all modules
    it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts
    used to control compilation and\ninstallation of the executable. However, as a
    special exception, the source\ncode distributed need not include anything that
    is normally distributed (in\neither source or binary form) with the major components
    (compiler, kernel,\nand so on) of the operating system on which the executable
    runs, unless that\ncomponent itself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution
    of executable or object code is made by offering access to\ncopy from a designated
    place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same
    place counts as distribution of the source code,\neven though third parties are
    not compelled to copy the source along with\nthe object code.\n\n4. You may not
    copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided
    under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,\nmodify, sublicense or distribute
    the Program is void, and will automatically\nterminate your rights under this
    License. However, parties who have received\ncopies, or rights, from you under
    this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties
    remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License,
    since you have not signed\nit. However, nothing else grants you permission to
    modify or distribute the\nProgram or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited
    by law if you\ndo not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
    the\nProgram (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance
    of\nthis License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\ndistributing
    or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute
    the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives
    a license from the original\nlicensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
    subject to these terms\nand conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
    on the\nrecipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible\nfor
    enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence
    of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason
    (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court
    order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
    they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
    so\nas to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\nother
    pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute\nthe Program
    at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\nroyalty-free redistribution
    of the Program by all those who receive copies\ndirectly or indirectly through
    you, then the only way you could satisfy both\nit and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the\nProgram.\n\nIf any portion of this
    section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the
    balance of the section is intended to apply and\nthe section as a whole is intended
    to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce
    you to infringe any patents\nor other property right claims or to contest validity
    of any such claims;\nthis section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity
    of the free\nsoftware distribution system, which is implemented by public license\npractices.
    Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of\nsoftware distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent\napplication of that system; it
    is up to the author/donor to decide if he or\nshe is willing to distribute software
    through any other system and a\nlicensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section
    is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of
    the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program
    is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
    the original\ncopyright holder who places the Program under this License may add
    an\nexplicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so\nthat
    distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.\nIn such
    case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the\nbody of this
    License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of\nthe General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be\nsimilar
    in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems
    or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
    Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater
    version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of
    that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.
    If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose
    any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n10. If you wish
    to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\nwhose distribution
    conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\npermission. For software
    which is copyrighted by the Free Software\nFoundation, write to the Free Software
    Foundation; we sometimes make\nexceptions for this. Our decision will be guided
    by the two goals of\npreserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
    software and of\npromoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO
    WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR\nTHE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE
    STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM
    \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
    A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO\nTHE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM\nPROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST
    OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\nCORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED
    BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER
    PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
    TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
    NOT LIMITED TO\nLOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
    BY YOU OR\nTHIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS),
    EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New
    Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible\nuse to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software\nwhich
    everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the
    following notices to the program. It is safest to\nattach them to the start of
    each source file to most effectively convey the\nexclusion of warranty; and each
    file should have at least the \"copyright\"\nline and a pointer to where the full
    notice is found.\n\none line to give the program's name and an idea of what it
    does.\nCopyright (C) 19yy  name of author\n\nThis program is free software; you
    can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public
    License\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\nof the
    License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed
    in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the
    implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See

    and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice
    like this when\nit starts in an interactive mode:\n\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright
    (C) 19yy name of author\nGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details\ntype
    `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome\nto redistribute it under
    certain conditions; type `show c'\nfor details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show
    w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.
    Of course, the commands you use may be\ncalled something other than `show w' and
    `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
    program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
    your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.
    Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright\ninterest

    General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary

    to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary. If this is what
    you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public\nLicense instead of this License.\n"
