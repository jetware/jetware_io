    license\n\nBased on the discussion at http://octave.1599824.n4.nabble.com/Can-we-freely-use-AMOS-in-Octave-td4642557.html,
    AMOS is included in openspecfun as public domain software\n\n> The AMOS functions
    are included in SLATEC, and the SLATEC guide \n> (http://www.netlib.org/slatec/guide)
    explicitly states: \n>\n>     \"The Library is in the public domain and distributed
    by the Energy \n>     Science and Technology Software Center.\" \n>\n> Mention
    of AMOS's inclusion in SLATEC goes back at least to this 1985 \n> technical report
    from Sandia National Labs: \n>      http://infoserve.sandia.gov/sand_doc/1985/851018.pdf\n"
