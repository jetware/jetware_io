This is runtime environment for tutorials of the MIT 6.S094 course: Deep
Learning for Self-Driving Cars.

###### Runtime environment

The runtime environment includes everything needed for the DeepCars and
DeepTesla examples and tutorials from the course. All programs are built,
installed, configured, tested, and are ready to use.

There are different software bundles (appliances), optimized for different
hardware capabilities: x86 CPU only, or x86 CPU with NVidia GPU.

###### DeepCars

DeepCars include notebooks with an example of implementing the Perceptron,
an example of implementing a neural network using TensorFlow. It also
includes an example of the traffic light recognition with program code
and images for training.

###### DeepTesla

DeepTesla is a tutorial with the end-to-end steering model using a videostream
for input.

The tutorial includes Python script for training and prediction, video files
for neural network training (~200 Mb). The neural network and video processing
are based on TensorFlow and OpenCV libraries.
