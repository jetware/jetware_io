This is a runtime environment for tutorials and examples of the Stanford's
CS20 course: Tensorflow for Deep Learning Research.

###### Runtime environment

The runtime environment includes everything needed for the examples and
tutorials from the course. All programs are built, installed, configured,
tested, and are ready to use.

There are different software bundles (appliances), optimized for different
hardware capabilities: x86 CPU only, or x86 CPU with NVidia GPU.
